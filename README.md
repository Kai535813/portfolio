### Calculator (2025)

This Processing program is an interactive graphical calculator that supports both keyboard and mouse input. It performs standard arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—as well as advanced functions such as square root, sine, cosine, negation (±), and random number generation.
The interface is built using a custom Button class that manages rendering, color changes on hover, and click detection. The calculator maintains internal state variables for the left and right operands, the selected operator, and the display value. Results are dynamically updated on a digital-style display.
Overall, the project demonstrates structured event handling, object-oriented interface design, and integration of mathematical operations within an interactive Processing environment.

Technologies Used:
Language: Java (Processing)
Environment: Processing IDE
Concepts: OOP, event-driven programming, GUI design, real-time feedback

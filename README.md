### Calculator (2025)

This project is a fully interactive scientific calculator developed using Processing, a Java-based graphical programming environment. The calculator features a clean graphical user interface (GUI) and supports basic arithmetic operations. 

Core Functionalities:
Basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
Advanced operations: square root, sine, cosine, negation (Â±), and random number generation
Decimal input handling for floating-point calculations
Interactive display that shows current inputs and results in real-time

Technical Highlights:
Object-oriented design using a custom Button class to manage interactivity
Mouse-based event handling with hover detection and click recognition
Input state management (left operand, right operand, and operation tracking)
Prevention of invalid operations (e.g., multiple decimals, negative square roots)

Technologies Used:
Language: Java (Processing)
Environment: Processing IDE
Concepts: OOP, event-driven programming, GUI design, real-time feedback
